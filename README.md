# Lean
Here is a project I did as a Data Analyst beginer. Analysing sales of electronic gadgets in different Cities in Bahrain. I used Python as my tool for this analysis. I did some data cleaning and data visualizaton. 
From the visualization, we can clearly see how sales changes over time, highest sales by city and the relationship between age and salary.
